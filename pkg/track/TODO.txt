* make the system more robust to NA values in the object summary table
  -- if these exist, should replace them with correct values

* make track.auto() check if the object summary and filemap on disk
  have changed -- if they have, and the changes are consistent with
  object changes on disk, read those in over the current values in memory.
  (Use case is when track.move() moves objects away, or adds some new
   objects.)
  Could also think about checking mod times when writing a new
  object summary, and maybe reading in a changed version...

* change to use a custom generic save/load function to allow objects
  to use their own save/read/access functions.

* think about whether should just make .Last a non-tracked variable; it
  causes track.stop() when called from q() (as in testBrokenFileSystem.Rt)
  to need to save the tracking summary (because .Last was accessed, which
  changed the tracking summary).

* make interactive track.stop() handle more gracefully the situation where the
  tracking db becomes unavailable: disconnect all active bindings,
  but keep unsaved objects in place

* DONE: make track.start() read in .Last so that if the tracking
  db becomes unavailable, R can still shut down (because .Last will
  be cached, allowing it to be retrieved without accessing the
  file system.)

* DONE: make end-of-top-level-command syncing and cache flushing
  work in a global way doing all environments at once,
  allowing a policy to work across all tracked environments.

* DONE write a LRU policy plugin for caching -- add an
  option for how many bytes to keep, and flush from memory
  enough older objects to get under the limit

* DONE: add track.assign() that is like track(), but doesn't
  cache the value

* DONE: add a "track.plugin" man page and examples of use

* DONE: make the callback catch errors and always return TRUE, so
  that it doesn't get removed.  make track.auto(TRUE) check
  that the callback is in place.

* DONE: add 'inmem' & 'envname' to the args passed to a cacheKeepFun

* DONE: figure out a way of using full commands in history without
  inserting time stamps into the interactive history.

* DONE: link track.rescan() from track.sync.Rd

* DONE: track.stop() behaving weirdly -- saw tracking envs still attached -- fixed

* make track.sync issue a warning if variables are created in
  a readonly tracked env

* DONE: clean up examples in .Rd files -- make them simple
  pedagogic examples, not tests of functionality (the latter
  are in tests/*.Rt)

* add FILE access and FILE write counters to the trackingSummary

* request .Last hook and a .Last.pre.ask hook (pre-question)
  (would go in src/gnuwin/system.c.  Printing messages from
  .Last is tricky because of order of how things appear to
  user: first comes the question, then if the answer to
  "save?" is not cancel, .Last is run, and save.image()
  called.
  - src/gnuwin32/system.c: in R_Cleanup, call to R_dot_Last
  - src/unix/sys-std.c: in Rstd_Cleanup, call to R_dot_Last
  - src/main/main.c: defn of function R_dot_Last
  - example of hook calling in

* test turning off writeToDisk and having that handled by track.sync() (need to think about what happens when an error in the computation occurs)

* write tests that .Last invoked flushing at the end of the R
  session does write out objects (a little tricky to test
  because the test needs to span multiple sessions)

* write tests that GC-triggered flushing at the end of the R
  session does write out objects (a little tricky to test
  because the test needs to span multiple sessions) However:
  This can't work very well because save.image() at the end
  will be run before finalizers

* DONE: make it easier to attach a new tracking env at position 2
 (current track.start(pos = 2, dir = "tmp4") gets several errors)

* DONE: need to store Sys.pid() in tracking env to detect
  situations where .trackingEnv was loaded back into the
  global env by saveimage()/loadimage(), but things are not
  set up properly.

* DONE: track.info() should detect the situation where
  .trackingEnv was saved & restored and is not active (look
  at saved pid)

* DONE: make track.history.load() filter out timestamps by default
* DONE: Think about automatic caching and garbage collection: now when a tracking env is garbage-collected at the end of the R session, if it isn't already flushed, it is flushed.
* DONE: write .Last.sys function that will call track.stop() (which calls track.sync(full=TRUE) and track.flush())
* add tests to testFollowObjs.Rout.save with recordAccesses=FALSE, and separately
  with maintainSummary=FALSE
* DONE: add tests for track.start(clobber="vars") and track.start(clobber="files")
* DONE: in track.start(), when clobbering files, make sure current var binding is not active (actually, this doesn't matter no -- we remove all clobbered var bindings before reassinging), and that var is trackable -- now gives a warning for untrackable/reserved/excluded var names
* DONE: in track.start(), need to check that files exist before clobbering vars, had this situation - now stop with an error message
* DONE: in track.stop(), replace .Last active binding by its value? (otherwise get an error when trying to run it?) - no seems OK
* DONE: in track.sync() handle the case \code{master="files"} and where objects are cached and where an underlying file is changed. (all cached objects are deleted)
* DONE: check if track.sync(master="file") is the same as track.rescan() - is now
* DONE: add argument to track.stop() to keep variables in R (do via track.remove/track.lift?)
* DONE: add tests for track.rescan(level="low") with changed file db (based on code in track.attach.Rt)
* DONE: add a read-only mode, and make that the default for track.attach()
* DONE: think about using lockEnvironment/lockBinding for a readonly tracking enviornment -- disadvantage is that it is a lot of work to change between readonly=TRUE and readonly=FALSE (solution was to just use lockEnvironment())
* DONE: write tests for track.attach(readonly=TRUE/FALSE)
* DONE: add docs to trackObjs-package.Rd to emphasize simple usage.
* DONE: add tests for track.attach()
* DONE: add track.auto() function to control use of auto-tracking (turn on and off, show status)
* DONE: change tests over to use auto=TRUE (the default), or duplicate for that case
* DONE: figure out what to do about the case of {rm(x); x <- 1} when auto=TRUE -- this results in x not having an active binding, i.e., it is masked -- maybe detect this by a cleanup on exit function, and/or by running a more general check every 5 mins
