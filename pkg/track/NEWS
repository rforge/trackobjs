                CHANGES in track version 1.0-20 (2013-01-07)
CHANGES
    o   Detect when a read-only db has been modified and rescan
        it automatically.
    o	Fix bug where track.rename was deleting the DB file when
        both the original and new object names were non-simple.

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-19 (2012-09-22)
CHANGES
    o   Tweak examples to write in R's tempdir() rather than
        the current working directory.
    o   track.start() when finding variables of the same
        name will check if they are the same object, and proceed
        if they are, instead of stopping with an error.  This
        check is only performed if the total size of objects
        and files is below a threshold.

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-15 (2012-04-12)
CHANGES
    o   Remove use of .Internal() (R CMD check objects)

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-14 (2012-02-26)
FIXES
    o   Give more informative warning messages when the caching
        plugin function returns values other than TRUE/FALSE.

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-13 (2011-12-10)
FIXES
    o   Redo the way a fake version of Sys.time() was being
        used for testing.  New technique avoids modifying
        Sys.time() in baseenv.

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-11 (2011-10-18)
FIXES
    o   Better detection of directories under windows() --
        was failing to load a tracking DB on a network
        file system under windows because file.exists() was
        incorrectly reporting that the directory didn't exist.

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-10 (2011-09-29)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   from= argument on track.move()/track.copy() can take a vector
    o   add skipExisting= argument to track.move()/track.copy()
FIXES
    o   track.start(discardMissing=TRUE) was not working.
    o   track.rebuild() was not working in some cases; fixed &
        added tests

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-8 (2011-05-01)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Changed task callback 'track.auto' to call track.sync()
        for all tracked environments, rather than having one
        callback for each environment.  This will allow better
        management of caching.

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-7 (2011-04-25)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Changed default value for cacheKeepFun to track.plugin.lru
        to implement a Least Recently Used policy for clearing
        objects from the cache.

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-5 (2011-03-25)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Added track.assign()

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-4 (2011-03-18)
FIXES
    o   Use full argument names in ls(), get() and exists()
        as recommended by R CMD check.

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-3 (2011-02-19)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Revised order of options in track.options() to be
        alphabetical, and cleaned up documentation of options
        in ?track.options

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-2 (2011-01-22)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Add an "alwaysCache" option and populate it with ".Last"
        so that q() is possible from R even when globalenv
        tracking env becomes unavailable (e.g., due to a
        network drive becoming unavailable)

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-1 (2011-01-22)
FIXES
    o   Make test-output mismatches in tests/show.envs.Rt into
        warnings not errors (is failing to match on Solaris).

                CHANGES in track version 1.0-0 (2010-11-07)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Changed package name from 'trackObjs' to 'track'
    o   Many incremental improvments in efficiency, stability
        and functionality (especially around auto-tracking).
    o   Added functions track.copy() and track.move()
    o   Added incremental history mechanism
    o   Added plugin function feature for specifying which
        objects should be cached.

                CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.9-3 (2010-07-17)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Major improvement in user level functionality: added
        ability to auto-track new and deleted variables using
        task callbacks (on by default).  This means that all
        the user has to do to track all created objects (and
        keep up with deletions) is to issue the command
        track.start() once to start tracking.
    o   made 'rdatadir' the default directory for storing
        R objects
    o   added new function track.attach() to attach an existing
        db of objects to the search path.  Has a readonly
        mode that prevents changing any files on disk.
    o   add four new option components:
           - readonly: logical value indicating whether the
               environment is readonly
           - autoTrackExcludePattern: vector of regexps specifying
               vars not to track automatically
           - autoTrackExcludeClass: vector of class names for
               which objects should not be tracked
           - clobberVars: vector of variable names that can be
               silently clobbered when attaching a tracking db.
               The default is ".Random.seed", to avoid annoying
               errors/messages about the variable .Random.seed
               (which can be created by various functions).
    o   change track(x <- value) so that if x already exists, or
        is already tracked, x still gets the new value
    o   renamed track.restart() to track.rescan()

                CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-6 (2009-11-03)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Fix documentation links so that they pass the stricter
        tests in R CMD check.

                CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-3 (2009-02-20)
BUG FIXES
    o   Make each test use a unique tracking database so that
        tests don't interfere with each other when run in parallel.

                CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-0
BUG FIXES
    o   Fixed faulty detection of conflicting existing objects
        when starting to track to an existing directory.

    o   Replaced environment on function that is in the active
        binding for a tracked object.  Previously, that function
        could, if constructed via track(obj <- value), have a
        copy of the tracked object in its environment, which would
        stay present taking up memory even if the object was
        flushed out of the tracking environment.

    o   Fixed bug that stopped track.stop(all=TRUE) from working
