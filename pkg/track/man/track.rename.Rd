\title{
  Rename variables in a tracked environment
}
\description{
  Rename variables in a tracked environment
}
\usage{
track.rename(old, new, pos = 1, envir = as.environment(pos),
             clobber = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{old}{
    character vector of old names
}
  \item{new}{
    character vector of new names (must be same length as 'old')
}
  \item{pos}{
    The position on the search list of the tracked db.  Can be numeric or
    the name as returned by \code{search()}.
}
\item{envir}{
  The tracked environment.
}
\item{clobber}{
  Should existing variables be overwritten?
}
  \item{verbose}{
Write out what is being done?
}
}
\details{
  Variables retain their tracked/untracked status (with the exception
  that a tracked variable can go from being tracked to being untracked
  if the new name matches the tracking option \code{autoTrackExcludePattern}.)

  Renaming works correctly when old and new names overlap, e.g.,
  \code{track.rename(c("x","y"), c("y","x"))} will swap the values of
  \code{x} and \code{y}.
}
\value{
  A list containing the old and new names:
\item{old}{a character vector of names}
\item{new}{a character vector of names}

##############################################################
# Warning: running this example will cause variables currently
# in the R global environment to be written to .RData files
# in a tracking database on the filesystem under R's temporary
# directory, and will cause the variables to be removed temporarily
# from the R global environment.
# It is recommended to run this example with a fresh R session
# with no important variables in the global environment.
