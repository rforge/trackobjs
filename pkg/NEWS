                CHANGES in track version 1.0-0 (2010-11-07)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Changed package name from 'trackObjs' to 'track'
    o   Many incremental improvments in efficiency, stability
        and functionality (especially around auto-tracking).
    o   Added functions track.copy() and track.move()
    o   Added incremental history mechanism
    o   Added plugin function feature for specifying which
        objects should be cached.

                CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.9-3 (2010-07-17)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Major improvement in user level functionality: added
        ability to auto-track new and deleted variables using
        task callbacks (on by default).  This means that all
        the user has to do to track all created objects (and
        keep up with deletions) is to issue the command
        track.start() once to start tracking.
    o   made 'rdatadir' the default directory for storing
        R objects
    o   added new function track.attach() to attach an existing
        db of objects to the search path.  Has a readonly
        mode that prevents changing any files on disk.
    o   add four new option components:
           - readonly: logical value indicating whether the
               environment is readonly
           - autoTrackExcludePattern: vector of regexps specifying
               vars not to track automatically
           - autoTrackExcludeClass: vector of class names for
               which objects should not be tracked
           - clobberVars: vector of variable names that can be
               silently clobbered when attaching a tracking db.
               The default is ".Random.seed", to avoid annoying
               errors/messages about the variable .Random.seed
               (which can be created by various functions).
    o   change track(x <- value) so that if x already exists, or
        is already tracked, x still gets the new value
    o   renamed track.restart() to track.rescan()

                CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-6 (2009-11-03)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Fix documentation links so that they pass the stricter
        tests in R CMD check.

                CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-3 (2009-02-20)
BUG FIXES
    o   Make each test use a unique tracking database so that
        tests don't interfere with each other when run in parallel.

                CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-0
BUG FIXES
    o   Fixed faulty detection of conflicting existing objects
        when starting to track to an existing directory.

    o   Replaced environment on function that is in the active
        binding for a tracked object.  Previously, that function
        could, if constructed via track(obj <- value), have a
        copy of the tracked object in its environment, which would
        stay present taking up memory even if the object was
        flushed out of the tracking environment.

    o   Fixed bug that stopped track.stop(all=TRUE) from working
