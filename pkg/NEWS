		CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.9-0 (2010-06-15)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   add ability to auto-track new and deleted variables using
        task callbacks (on by default)
    o   add two new option components:
           - autoTrackExclude: vector of regexps specifying vars
               not to track automatically
           - clobberVars: vector of variable names that can be
               silently clobbered when attaching a tracking db.
	       The default is ".Random.seed".
               (to avoid annoying errors/messages about variables
                .Random.seed)
    o   change track(x <- value) so that if x already exists, or
        is already tracked, x still gets the new value

		CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-6 (2009-11-03)
ENHANCEMENTS
    o   Fix documentation links so that they pass the stricter
        tests in R CMD check.

		CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-3 (2009-02-20)
BUG FIXES
    o	Make each test use a unique tracking database so that
    	tests don't interfere with each other when run in parallel.

		CHANGES in trackObjs version 0.8-0
BUG FIXES
    o   Fixed faulty detection of conflicting existing objects
        when starting to track to an existing directory.

    o   Replaced environment on function that is in the active
        binding for a tracked object.  Previously, that function
        could, if constructed via track(obj <- value), have a
        copy of the tracked object in its environment, which would
        stay present taking up memory even if the object was
        flushed out of the tracking environment.

    o   Fixed bug that stopped track.stop(all=TRUE) from working
