* add tests for track.attach()
* write .Last function that will call track.sync(force=TRUE), and that will call save.image() after detaching() the tracking dir.

* add argument to track.stop() to keep variables (do via track.remove/track.lift?)
* add tests to testFollowObjs.Rout.save with recordAccesses=FALSE, and separately
  with maintainSummary=FALSE
* DONE: add track.auto() function to control use of auto-tracking (turn on and off, show status)
* DONE: change tests over to use auto=TRUE (the default), or duplicate for that case
* DONE: figure out what to do about the case of {rm(x); x <- 1} when auto=TRUE -- this results in x not having an active binding, i.e., it is masked -- maybe detect this by a cleanup on exit function, and/or by running a more general check every 5 mins
