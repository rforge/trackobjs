* in track.start(), when clobbering files, make sure current var binding is not active, and that var is trackable
* add tests for track.start(clobber="vars") and track.start(clobber="files")
* add tests for track.rescan(level="low") with changed file db (based on code in track.attach.Rt)
* in track.stop(), replace .Last active binding by its value (otherwise get an error when trying to run it?)
* in track.start(), need to check that files exist before clobbering vars, had this situation

Error in getTrackedVar("mtime", <environment>) :

* in track.sync() handle the case \code{master="files"} and where objects are cached and where an underlying file is changed.
* check if track.sync(master="file") is the same as track.rescan() - no it isn't
* write .Last function that will call track.sync(force=TRUE), track.stop(), and that will call save.image() after detaching() the tracking dir. (.Last gets called before save.image() in the Windows GUI)
* add tests to testFollowObjs.Rout.save with recordAccesses=FALSE, and separately
  with maintainSummary=FALSE
* add argument to track.stop() to keep variables in R (do via track.remove/track.lift?)
* DONE: add a read-only mode, and make that the default for track.attach()
* DONE: think about using lockEnvironment/lockBinding for a readonly tracking enviornment -- disadvantage is that it is a lot of work to change between readonly=TRUE and readonly=FALSE (solution was to just use lockEnvironment())
* DONE: write tests for track.attach(readonly=TRUE/FALSE)
* DONE: add docs to trackObjs-package.Rd to emphasize simple usage.
* DONE: add tests for track.attach()
* DONE: add track.auto() function to control use of auto-tracking (turn on and off, show status)
* DONE: change tests over to use auto=TRUE (the default), or duplicate for that case
* DONE: figure out what to do about the case of {rm(x); x <- 1} when auto=TRUE -- this results in x not having an active binding, i.e., it is masked -- maybe detect this by a cleanup on exit function, and/or by running a more general check every 5 mins
