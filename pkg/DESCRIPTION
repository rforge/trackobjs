Title: Track Objects
Author: Tony Plate <tplate@acm.org>
Maintainer: Tony Plate <tplate@acm.org>
Description: Automatically stores objects in files on disk so that
  files are rewritten when objects are changed, and so
  that objects are accessible but do not occupy memory until
  they are accessed. Also tracks times when objects are created
  and modified, and caches some basic characteristics of objects
  to allow for fast summaries of objects.
