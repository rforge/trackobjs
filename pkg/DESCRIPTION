Title: Track Objects
Author: Tony Plate <tplate@acm.org>
Maintainer: Tony Plate <tplate@acm.org>
Description: Automatically stores objects in files on disk
  so that files are rewritten when objects are changed, and
  so that objects are accessible but do not occupy memory
  until they are accessed. Also tracks times when objects
  are created and modified, and caches some basic
  characteristics of objects to allow for fast summaries of
  objects.  Also provides a command history mechanism that
  saves the last command to a history file after each
  command completes.
